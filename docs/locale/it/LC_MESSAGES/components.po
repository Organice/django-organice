"Editing your website is not much different from surfing the web.  When "
"you're logged in to your website you will have the django CMS toolbar on top"
" of the page.  Press the blue \"Edit\" button to go into Edit mode.  When "
"you now hover over the website elements you'll notice tooltips (\"Double-"
"click to edit\").  Double-click on those areas, and an editor window will "
"open up to allow you to modify the content."

"You can safely modify content on the page without the website to change.  "
"Only you can see the changes, and only as long as you are in Edit mode.  "
"When you're happy with the changes press the blue \"Publish changes\" button"
" on the django CMS toolbar to make your version visible to the world."

"For more technical tasks like creating a navigation structure, adding pages,"
" etc. the django CMS toolbar redirects you to the Django administration "
"interface.  Want to have an upfront first impression before using it?  Check"
" out the (slightly outdated) django CMS `video on frontend-editing`_."

msgid ""
"Writing and publishing interesting articles now and then is called "
"\"blogging\".  It's very similar to the usual editing of your website, but "
"still it's different because you get more features as a natural add-on:  "
"Categories, tagging, comments, publication dates, archives (yearly, monthly,"
" daily), related entries, RSS feeds, etc."

"On your website you simply go to the Blog area, and click on the \"Add\" "
"link, which is available when you're logged in. In the blog entry editor you"
" have all functionality you already know from the content management "
"section.  Modifying existing blog entries works identical to the usual "
"content changes on your website with the exception of publishing, which is "
"not available with an intermediate draft step:  All your changes are "
"immediately visible online."
msgstr ""

#: ../../components.rst:39

"Note that in django Organice we also use the blog functionality for other "
"use cases that are very similar to the usual blogging, such as event "
"agendas, job postings, press releases, download lists, etc."

"Sending out news or updates to a circle of friends or customers is managed "
"by the Newsletter component, which is available from the Django "
"administration interface when you're logged in to your website.  Simply "
"click on \"Admin > Site Administration\" on the django CMS toolbar, and go "
"to the Newsletter section in Django administration."

"This component has a couple of powerful features.  It's best explained "
"having you watch the interesting French `overview video`_ from the Emencia "
